# Sentiment Analysis on Twitter data 

Twitter data is preprocessed and explored using standard NLP techniques, including tokenization and stemming.
4 algorithms were experimented with, including 2 classical machine learning models (Logistic Regression and SVM) and 2 deep learning methods (RNN and LSTM).

Overall, the best performing model was LSTM.
